# Character Detection Model
### YoloV3 for Character Detection have been used.
### Model is Trained on Approximate 1000 Images with each having 8-10 characters.
### Acc : 84.66%
### IOU : 74.25%

# How To Use ?
##### Step 1 
* Download Our Weights File From [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DC7a8VNodvJYHZwn1pl8bPj0EYOh086H/view?usp=sharing)
* Put this Weights File in Weights Folder in Character_Detection Folder

##### step 2
* Install Python 3.8.0
https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Install numpy
> !pip install numpy
* Install opencv
* for CPU
> !pip install opencv-python

* If you want to use GPU You have to build opencv from source with cuda support which will increase perfomance of the model.

##### step 3
* run Python file 
> !python CharsDetector.py

* It will Show results for all imgs available in Test_Images folder.
* And also Write output files in results folder.
